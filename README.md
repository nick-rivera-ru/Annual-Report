# Annual-Report
This is an example of a dynamic Excel report that I can put together for you.

The report is dynamic as it allows the user to change both the year and the KPIs in the scope of the report. The report updates as the user updates the controls.  
For example, if the year is adjusted to 2023 the report will update to reflect the year-over-year between 2023 & 2022. Likewise, the user can change the Operating Profit KPI to a Gross Profit KPI and the report will update accordingly. 

While this report looks at the performance of the overall organization, it's completely feasible (with a few adjustments) to report at a more granular level ie by category, by operating region etc.
